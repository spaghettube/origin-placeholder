# origin-placeholder

creating an origin as a comission from a friend

<details>
  <summary>idea 1 - shinobi</summary>

this is an idea for a non gameplay intrusive origin based on some abilities from the Naruto show. purpose is giving the player more buffs than nerfs, essentially making them a more powerful version of the default player

as per the purpose of making this non intrusive, i will try and refrain from including stamina bars, and stick to timed cooldowns with no visual feedback for cooldown start/end

according to the name of the origin "Shinobi" im not focusing on one specific character from the show, but rather abilities that are commonly used by every ninja. its been a while since ive watched the show though


passive abilities
- permanent attribute speed boost (additive)
- 

active abilities
- substitution (maybe if crouched and max 2 charges cooldown idk yet)
