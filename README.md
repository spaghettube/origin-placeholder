creating an origins in collab with friend(s)

  <summary>idea 1 - shinobi</summary>

this is an idea for a non gameplay intrusive origin based on some abilities from the Naruto show. purpose is giving the player more buffs than nerfs, essentially making them a more powerful version of the default player, possibly a impact 1/2

as per the purpose of making this non intrusive, i will try and refrain from including stamina bars, and stick to timed cooldowns with no visual feedback for cooldown start/end

according to the name of the origin "Shinobi" im not focusing on one specific character from the show, but rather abilities that are commonly used by every ninja. its been a while since ive watched the show though


### passive abilities
- permanent attribute speed boost (additive)
- permanent attack speed (has to be %)

### active abilities
- substitution (maybe if crouched, maybe max 2 charges, 5<x<20 tick cooldown, recharge idk yet)
- summoning (could use frog with pehkui, maybe use frog as either tank or healer)
- arrow in main-hand acts as kunai (can be thrown, not much damage)

  <summary>idea 2 - 11th harbinger</summary>

  basically childe from genshin, (hopefully) including base, delusion and foul legacy.

  foul legacy's basically a strong transformation that leaves you pretty weak after using it. there will probably be a stamina bar for it idfk lmao tiger's the one who knows this stuff not me. I mean it'd be unfun to play as anything else if there wasn't a stamina bar to counteract being strong

  ### passive abilities
  - permanent melee damage increase
  - permanent reduced damage with ranged weapons
  - ability to wield two melee weapons at once (this isn't a thing in regular minecraft right)
  - make enemies "wet" when hit (uhhh idk makes them slower ig?? idt we're gonna have the entire elemental reaction system here right lol)

  ### active abilities
  - delusion transformation (damage boost)
  - foul legacy transformation or something (speed/damage/resistance boost, but with a limited duration. main drawback is that it leaves you extra weak; slower, less damage, less resistance. you do eventually go back to normal tho)
