idea 3 - legacy combatant

an origin to replicate a "1.8 pvp" player

this origin is meant for those legacy pvp crutchers, either to make them more comfortable playing on newer versions, or to make them realistically be on equal footing on a one on one battle in newer versions

the toughest part about this origin will surely be balancing combat with one less variable (attack cooldown)

the idea is to make the player's abilities as default's as a human's, whilst merging them with "1.8 pvp"

### passive abilities
- no attack cooldown - done
- damage nerf (has to be %) - done, needs % conversion + sharpness check
- no shield - done

### active abilities
- allow projectile knockback (gotta figure this out technically)

probably useful:

2.1^{0.05a}\cdot(b^{0.55}+a-1)+1-b on desmos, kinda innacurate in game rn idk why
