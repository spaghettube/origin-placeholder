idea 5 - strong arm

strong arm provides the player with a literal strong arm, every ability is based on sheer force and its consequences

however you only have one strong arm, your other one has always been neglected in training and is limp and useless

### passive abilities
- no off-hand
- noticeable damage buff (additive)
- head smash (every crit has a (10<x<40)% chance to teleport opponent one block down)

### active abilities
- ground punch (activate with keybind + looking down, make entities around get sent upwards, maybe make a random amount of block come up too?)
- strong punch (keybind ability, gotta think if toggle with stamina or one time use, deal considerable damage and knockback on punch)
