idea 4 - melee master

the purpose of the melee master origin is to provide a player the edge strictly on hand to hand combat

this origin is for those who are accustomed to manipulating their own movement, and the enemy's knockback, and often feel the lack of positive feedback from it 

### passive abilities
- variable knockback manipulation (gotta think about it)
- permanent subtle damage nerf (has to be %)
- permanent noticeable ranged nerf (has to be %)

### active abilities
- grapple mechanic (pull enemy towards you with velocity)
- parry mechanic (maybe crouch with timed interval, either null own kb or deal kb to opponent)
