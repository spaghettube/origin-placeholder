idea 1 - shinobi

this is an idea for a non gameplay intrusive origin based on some abilities from the Naruto show. purpose is giving the player more buffs than nerfs, essentially making them a more powerful version of the default player, possibly a impact 1/2

as per the purpose of making this non intrusive, i will try and refrain from including stamina bars, and stick to timed cooldowns with no visual feedback for cooldown start/end

according to the name of the origin "Shinobi" im not focusing on one specific character from the show, but rather abilities that are commonly used by every ninja. its been a while since ive watched the show though


### passive abilities
- permanent attribute speed boost (additive)
- permanent attack speed (has to be %)
- permanent subtle armor toughness nerf (has to be %)

### active abilities
- substitution (maybe if crouched, maybe max 2 charges, 5<x<20 tick cooldown, recharge idk yet)
- summoning (could use frog with pehkui, maybe use frog as either tank or healer)
- {placeholder-item} in main-hand acts as kunai (can be thrown, not much damage, soft homing effect?)
