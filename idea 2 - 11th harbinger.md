idea 2 - 11th harbinger

  basically childe from genshin, (hopefully) including base, delusion and foul legacy.

  foul legacy's basically a strong transformation that leaves you pretty weak after using it. there will probably be a stamina bar for it idfk lmao tiger's the one who knows this stuff not me. I mean it'd be unfun to play as anything else if there wasn't a stamina bar to counteract being strong

  ### passive abilities
  - permanent melee damage increase
  - permanent reduced damage with ranged weapons
  - ability to wield two melee weapons at once (this isn't a thing in regular minecraft right)
  - make enemies "wet" when hit (uhhh idk makes them slower ig?? idt we're gonna have the entire elemental reaction system here right lol)
  - less damage dealt the "weaker" an opponent is. inverse is true for "stronger" opponents (for example, you're pretty weak against a cow, but get way stronger against a warden or sum shit, because you're hungry for battle against enemies stronger than you idk bro this is literally just childe genshin)

  ### active abilities
  - delusion transformation (speed/damage boost, enemies get "electrocuted" when hit (fuck idk stuns them bro again we're probably not gonna add the entire genshin elemental system for a few origins). has a limited duration. leaves you slower and dealing less damage after it runs out). you can activate it after getting enough "electro particles" (obtained upon killing enemies ig? still a wip so like teehee) and filling up the "delusion" bar.
  - foul legacy transformation or something (speed/damage/resistance boost, but with a limited duration (shorter than delusion). main drawback is that it leaves you extra weak; slower, less damage, less resistance (more exhausted than after delusion runs out). you do eventually go back to normal tho). you can activate it after getting enough overflow "electro particles", said overflow particles filling up an "abyssal energy" bar that, once full, lets you use foul legacy (this isn't too complicated for an origin right).
