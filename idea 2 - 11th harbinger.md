idea 2 - 11th harbinger

  basically childe from genshin, (hopefully) including base, delusion and foul legacy.

  foul legacy's basically a strong transformation that leaves you pretty weak after using it. there will probably be a stamina bar for it idfk lmao tiger's the one who knows this stuff not me. I mean it'd be unfun to play as anything else if there wasn't a stamina bar to counteract being strong

  ### passive abilities
  - permanent melee damage increase
  - permanent reduced damage with ranged weapons
  - ability to wield two melee weapons at once (this isn't a thing in regular minecraft right)
  - make enemies "wet" when hit (uhhh idk makes them slower ig?? idt we're gonna have the entire elemental reaction system here right lol)

  ### active abilities
  - delusion transformation (damage boost)
  - foul legacy transformation or something (speed/damage/resistance boost, but with a limited duration. main drawback is that it leaves you extra weak; slower, less damage, less resistance. you do eventually go back to normal tho)
